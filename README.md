TO DO (whenever I have the time)

- rewrite pretty much all of the JS and CSS to be neater and DRY; the code is terrible
- design using accessible colors (color contrast for the yellow used is awful)
- make the page more accessible in general (focus styles need a lot of work)
- work on mobile view 
- add transitions for showing / hiding the cart, adding an item to the cart, and removing an item from the cart
